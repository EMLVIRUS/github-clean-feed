> Browser Extension: Group news feed by repo

Every part is optional:

- Groups new stars
- Groups new forks
- Groups new repos and newly-public repos
- Hides branch creation/deletion
- Hides new commits
- Hides "collaborator added" events
- Hides tags and releases

Untouched/ungrouped events remain in the main feed.

In the future:

- Organize comments, issues, PRs

## Opera

You can install the Chrome extension in Opera by using [`Download Chrome Extension`](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en)
