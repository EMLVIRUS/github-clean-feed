# GitHub Grouped News [![Version published on Chrome Web Store](https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/failppjoidijbialknplliogdmabniaf.svg)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-grouped-news/failppjoidijbialknplliogdmabniaf)

> Browser Extension: Group news feed by repo

Every part is optional:

- Groups new stars
- Groups new forks
- Groups new repos and newly-public repos
- Hides branch creation/deletion
- Hides new commits

Note: It only applies to items on the first page of the news feed for now

Untouched/ungrouped events remain in the main feed.

## Opera

You can install the Chrome extension in Opera by using [`Download Chrome Extension`](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en)
