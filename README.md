## Chrome

## Firefox

Technically it's a [Web Extension](http://arewewebextensionsyet.com/), but it's untested. You can install it by loading the `manifest.json` from the page `about:debugging` and contribute if it doesn't work.

## Opera

You can install the Chrome extension in Opera by using [`Download Chrome Extension`](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en)
