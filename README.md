> Browser Extension: Group news feed by repo

Currently it:

- Groups new stars
- Groups new forks
- Groups new repos and newly-public repos
- Only applies to items on the first page of the news feed

Optionally:

- Move certain groups to the sidebar
- Hide certain events
- Always show/hide who starred the repos

Ungrouped events will stay in the list below the groups.

## Opera

You can install the Chrome extension in Opera by using [`Download Chrome Extension`](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en)
